# Demand Forcasts for Canada transportation Team 

### Overview of the Project 

One of the responsibilities of the Canada Transportation long and medium-term planning team is to determine the geospatial distribution of carrier coverage. Canada transportation team currently uses 1 year of historical data and average it per postal code to generate their forecasts each quarter, and seeks to improve their long and medium planning forecasts of customer demand in different geographical areas through automation. To meet these needs, the MOP team has developed 5 year-out demand forecasts for about 1,652 postal codes, which is currently at Forward Sortation Area (FSA) granularity level (Zip3) in Canada. This project will implement a system that will provide forecasts of the proportion of Amazon shipments in Canada per postal code region.
