# Demand Forecasts for Canada Transportation Team 

### Overview of the Project 

One of the responsibilities of the Canada Transportation long and medium-term planning team is to determine the geospatial distribution of carrier coverage. Canada transportation team currently uses 1 year of historical data and averages it per postal code to generate their forecasts each quarter. It seeks to improve its long and medium-planning forecasts of customer demand in different geographical areas through automation. To meet these needs, the MOP team has developed 5 year-out demand forecasts for about 1,652 postal codes, currently at Canada's Forward Sortation Area (FSA) granularity level (Zip3). This project will implement a system that will provide forecasts of the proportion of Amazon shipments in Canada per postal code region.
